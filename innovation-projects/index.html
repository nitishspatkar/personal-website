CEEX
Clean Energy Exchange (CEEX) is an energy trading platform that enables private households, among others, to store, buy and sell their own sustainably produced energy among themselves. Thanks to a powerful algorithm developed with ETH Zurich, prices are calculated in real time, individual trading strategies are made possible and the best electricity price for each player is guaranteed.

It comprises various sectors, including horse breeding, horse racing, tournaments, leisure riding, and horse-related products and services. The horse industry is a very traditional business and the goal of the project is to digitize the industry. 3forONE is pioneering in this area and has taken the first steps towards digitizing the horse industry. In this project, a first app solution has been developed that initially supports key aspects of the horse industry.

Traditional water testing methods often have limitations, like time-consuming lab analyses. New tools, including rapid testing kits, sensor-based monitoring systems, advanced analytical techniques, and data-driven approaches, are being developed to improve water quality assurance. These tools provide real-time monitoring, early detection of contamination, and comprehensive assessments of water quality. Artha is a Swiss startup leading this field. We have developed an initial cloud-based solution that collects data from various sources, such as water treatment plants, and visualizes that data on a custom dashboard.
