terms of behavior, and last in terms of interface.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Build one to throw away; you will, anyhow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good cooking takes time. If you are made to wait, it is to serve you better, and to please you.&rdquo;

Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations


&ldquo;We have a license to reinvent the world, because modelling the real world in our machinery (i.e., domain model) is not our goal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Our measure of success lies in how cleverly we invent a software reality that satisfies our application’s requirements— and not in how closely it resembles the real world.&rdquo;
